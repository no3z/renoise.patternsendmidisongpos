Renoise LUA script.

To be loaded inside renoise (v.2.8 tested) as a tool. Simply dragging and dropping the '.xrnx' folder inside Renoise will do.

It will send the current position of the song via a MIDI SongPos message. It attached to the idle handler and so it will send the position everytime it changes. 

Calculations are done based on a 64 pattern length. This can be changed inside the script.
